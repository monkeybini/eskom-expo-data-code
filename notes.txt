2n2-2n1+1= diff
twice len of 1 minus 1 is diff?



k=2m
if nxt>3m and nxt/a1=3


-then diff is prime or n
and diff(a2)= sp(2a1-1)

-and nxt(a2)=3a2

-diff(a2)/2-1/2=a2-a1

questions:
whats the first valid a1 after 3m

the first nxt(a1) = 3*k/2 +1
and a1 is < k so 3k>nxt>3k/2

so nxt(a1)=3*m+1 with nxt(1)=2m
if nxt(1)=2m then is nxt(a1)=3*m+1 also s.t nxt/a1=3

a1=
